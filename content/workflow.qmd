## Workflow

The process of generating a PDF document from Markdown using this project involves the following steps:

1. **Writing Content in Markdown**: Authors can write the content of their book or document in Markdown, storing these files in the `content/` directory.

2. **Configuring Quarto**: In the `_quarto.yml` file, authors specify the settings for Quarto to convert Markdown to LaTeX. This includes configurations such as document title, author, date, and LaTeX-specific settings.

3. **Using GitHub Actions for Automation**: When changes are pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions, as defined in `.github/workflows/`, automatically triggers the build process. The workflow installs Quarto, checks out the repository content, and runs the Quarto command to convert Markdown to LaTeX and then to PDF.

4. **Storing the Result with GitHub Release**: Once the PDF is generated, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a new release and attaches the PDF document to it. This makes the document accessible to users and provides version control for each release.
